ContainerWare is an application server. It listens on one or more endpoints
(which might be TCP/IP ports, FastCGI sockets, etc.) and passes requests to
application instances for processing. Depending upon the engine processing
the request, the instance might be one of a pool of threads, or child
processes, or something else.
